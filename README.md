#Spotify React Page

This is only the beginning of a project, unfortunately. Spent too
much time on the staff page. Ah well.

This is also new for me using the create-react-app library. It's quite a
bit faster of a setup, but took some adjusting. Ran out of time trying
to implement the GET request.

So far:
 - set up some routes
 - added a search bar that updates state on changes
 - a button the acknowledges being clicked
 - dug into the Spotify API and succeeded with API tests, but not with
 implementation
